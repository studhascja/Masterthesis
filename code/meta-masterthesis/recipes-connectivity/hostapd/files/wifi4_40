ieee80211d=1                      # Enable 802.11d for country-specific settings (important when roaming)
ieee80211n=1                      # Enable 802.11n (WiFi 4)

# === Radio and Band Settings ===

# === Security Settings ===

                                  # High Throughput (802.11n) capabilities:
                                  # HT40+: enable 40 MHz channel bonding (above control channel)
                                  # SHORT-GI-20: short guard interval for better speed
                                  # DSSS_CCK-40: allow CCK rates in 40 MHz mode (for compatibility)
                                  # MAX-AMSDU-3839: maximum A-MSDU size (improves throughput)
