# === General WiFi Configuration ===
interface=wlp1s0             # Wireless network interface (adjust to your system's device name)
driver=nl80211               # WiFi driver (nl80211 is standard for modern Linux systems)
ssid=jh_test                 # Name (SSID) of the wireless network

country_code=DE             # Country code for regulatory domain (affects legal channels and power)
ieee80211d=1                # Enable 802.11d for country-specific settings (important when roaming)
ieee80211n=1                # Enable 802.11n (WiFi 4)

# === Radio and Band Settings ===
hw_mode=a                   # Use 5 GHz band (802.11a and above)
channel=36                  # WiFi channel in 5 GHz band (UNII-1), corresponds to 5.180 GHz

wmm_enabled=1               # Enable WMM (Wireless Multimedia Extensions) for QoS

# === Security Settings ===
auth_algs=3                 # Authentication algorithms: 3 = both Open System and Shared Key (needed for WPA3-SAE)
macaddr_acl=0               # MAC address filtering: 0 = accept all except those in deny list
ignore_broadcast_ssid=0     # 0 = broadcast SSID (visible network), 1 = hide SSID
okc=1                       # Opportunistic Key Caching: speeds up roaming between APs
wpa=2                       # WPA mode: 2 = WPA2 (also enables mixed WPA2/WPA3 in some setups)
wpa_pairwise=CCMP CCMP-256  # Encryption for WPA: CCMP (AES) and 256-bit version
rsn_pairwise=CCMP CCMP-256  # Encryption for RSN/WPA2: same as above
wpa_psk_file=/etc/hostapd/hostapd.psk  # WPA/WPA2/WPA3 password file

# === Channel Width and Capabilities ===
ht_capab=[SHORT-GI-20][MAX-AMSDU-3839]  
                            # High Throughput (802.11n) capabilities:
                            # SHORT-GI-20: short guard interval for better speed
                            # MAX-AMSDU-3839: maximum frame aggregation size
